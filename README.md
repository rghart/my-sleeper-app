# Sleeper Team Assistant
_This app was built for personal use in 2020 and is in need of refactoring. Currently plan to migrate backend to [sleeper-player-be](https://github.com/rghart/sleeper-player-be) and move some of the helper functions here as well. Hope to migrate other portions of frontend/backend to Next.js and utilize server components._

Interacts with the [Sleeper API](https://docs.sleeper.com/) to pull league, team, and draft pick data to assist with drafts and setting your weekly lineup.

Main features include:
- Draft sync that updates as players are picked, and displays players left to pick, sorted by player rankings that you input
- Weekly lineup builder that lets you add players to your lineup according to your league's starter positions
- Copy + paste rankings to save for weekly lineup or draft selections
